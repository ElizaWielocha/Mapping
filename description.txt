Exact algorithm (recurrence search):
- loading from the file an instance of the mapping problem by the partial etching method (multiset A);
- constructing a restriction map consistent with the given multi-set 
 (one of the possible maps is enough);
- writing the result on the output in a way that is readable for the user; 
 in the absence of a solution (if the instance contains errors), the user should be informed by an appropriate message.
